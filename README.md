# FP9 .env Tutorial
Friday Project 9 by Ian Neely

This program is an AI-powered GUI that allows users to submit a prompt and receive an output in return. The user can enter prompts and use the AI model as many times as they'd like as long as they provide their *OWN API KEY* in the ".env" file.

*Before launching the python file*, locate the .env file. Upon opening the file, you will see:
__OPENAI_API_KEY=__

Insert your API Key *AFTER the "="* Your API Key should start with *"sk-proj-"*
__[For Example: OPEN_API_KEY=sk-proj-.....]__

After inserting your API Key, *save the .env file*. You are now ready to *run the python file*.
